# Miata NA Head Unit Mount

Dash mounting fixtures for universal 7" Android headunits. Carriers specifically designed for the [ATOTO S8 Gen 2](https://www.myatoto.com/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=15&id=68) and the older Joying JY-UL128N2. Should work for any 2 DIN head unit by simply moving around the mount points as needed in [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).

Tested and confirmed working in my [Miata NA (1990)](http://www.miata.net/gallery/na.html)

Although ABS would probably be better, I printed the carrier using HIPS filament on the following settings

* Layer height: 0.22
* Walls: 1.05
* Fill: 100
* Extruder: 240°
* Bed: 95°

Designed with [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/).
